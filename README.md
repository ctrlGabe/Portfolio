This is my week 2 homework: a deployed portfiolio page. I currently do not have any actual work to display in myy portfolio
so I filled it with personal information and pictures of my life. It is responsive and should work on all sizes of browser.
There is a navigation bar that will take you through all of my pages including an About Me page, a Portfolio page full of images, and a contact page.
